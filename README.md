Project: Classification - Loan Eligibility Prediction

Context:
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure by a borrower to repay the principal and interest owed to the lender. The lender uses the interest payments from the loan to compensate for the risk of potential losses. When the borrower defaults on his/her obligations, it causes an interruption in the cash flow of the lender.

In the banking sector, this is an important factor to be considered before approving the loan of an applicant in order to cushion the lender from loss of cash flow and reduce the severity of losses.

Objective:
Easy House is a finance company that deals in several varieties of home loans. They have a presence across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. Currently, the customer first applies for a home loan post which the company validates the customer's eligibility for that loan.

Now, the company wants to automate the loan eligibility process. They want to harness their past customers' data to build a model to predict whether the loan should be approved or not. This would help the company prevent potential losses, save time and focus more on eligible customers.
