# Project-Classification-LoanEligibilityPrediction
Project: Classification - Loan Eligibility Prediction

•	Explored factors influencing loan approval and developed a predictive model using historical customer data and conducted hyperparameter tuning using grid search and random search methods to optimize and adjust model performance.

•	Directed comprehensive EDA to understand the dataset's structure, distributions, and variable relationships, and applied feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance. 

•	Evaluated Logistic Regression and Decision Trees models based on accuracy, precision, feature importance and relevance to actual bank procedures for home loan approval. 

•	Achieved 86% accuracy for predicting loan eligibility using Logistic Regression and 79% using Decision Trees, with Precision of around 85% precision for classifying eligible customers for both models.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Context:
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure by a borrower to repay the principal and interest owed to the lender. The lender uses the interest payments from the loan to compensate for the risk of potential losses. When the borrower defaults on his/her obligations, it causes an interruption in the cash flow of the lender.

In the banking sector, this is an important factor to be considered before approving the loan of an applicant in order to cushion the lender from loss of cash flow and reduce the severity of losses.

Objective:
Easy House is a finance company that deals in several varieties of home loans. They have a presence across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. Currently, the customer first applies for a home loan post which the company validates the customer's eligibility for that loan.

Now, the company wants to automate the loan eligibility process. They want to harness their past customers' data to build a model to predict whether the loan should be approved or not. This would help the company prevent potential losses, save time and focus more on eligible customers.
